- URGENT: Avoid writing comments unless they are necessary to understand unconventional code. Remove unnecessary comments when updating code.
- Favor smaller diffs because they may fail to apply. For example, 2 diff representing the 2 segments of code instead of reproducing all the code between the 2 segments in 1 diff.
- We prefer conservative changes that maintain our production features.
